    text: 'This morning one of the dearest, sweetest friends I have ever had ended her suffering and is now with the angels. Kylee James, many will remember her as Pierce, was a beautiful woman, very smart, talented, loving, generous and kind. She gave me a place to lay my head many times and let me share her home with daughter, Julianna Pierce, who I call "my blonde child". Prayers for strength are asked for Julianna, and Kylee\'s sister and brother. As it happens, I will be in Birmingham the day of her funeral. Life is fragile.',

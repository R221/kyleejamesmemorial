  biography: `Kylee Grimes James, 65, of Birmingham, Alabama, passed away on December 17, 2025. She lived a life defined by love, faith, laughter, and service to others.

Kylee graduated from Eufaula High School and went on to earn her degree from Auburn University, where she developed a lifelong love for Auburn and its traditions. She became a registered pharmacist, a calling through which she expressed her deep care for people. Throughout her career, she served patients at UAB and later at a local Trussville pharmacy, where her compassion, attentiveness, and genuine concern for others left a lasting impact on all who knew her.

Kylee was deeply rooted in her faith. She loved attending Sunday school and her church—no matter where she was worshiping—and found great joy in singing hymns, especially during Christmas Eve services. Her faith was not just something she practiced, but something she lived out daily through kindness, generosity, and care for others.

She had a vibrant spirit and many passions. Kylee loved playing tennis with her group of friends each week, where matches were often followed by sharing recipes, laughter, and checking in on one another. She also enjoyed her time on stage in local theater productions across Birmingham, where she met lifelong friends and expressed her creative spirit. She proudly held leading roles in "Annie Get Your Gun" and "Our Town," along with appearances in many other productions that brought her great joy.

Kylee had an adventurous spirit. After marrying Jim James on January 5, 2013, in Birmingham, the two embraced life together with enthusiasm and curiosity, traveling to more than 29 countries during their marriage. Whether near or far, Kylee cherished experiences that allowed her to connect deeply with others and the world around her.

Family was the center of Kylee's life. She was the proud and devoted mother of her daughter, Julianna Pierce, and a loving stepmother to her stepson, Robert James. She was always present—at tennis matches, basketball games, Friday night movie-and-pizza traditions, and in every moment that mattered. She answered every phone call, no matter the time, and was always there when she was needed.

Kylee is survived by her loving husband, Jim James; her daughter, Julianna Pierce; her stepson, Robert James; her sister, Shana McGuire; and her brother, Mason John Grimes.

She leaves behind a legacy of faith, love, laughter, adventure, and unwavering devotion to family and friends. She will be deeply missed and forever remembered.`,
